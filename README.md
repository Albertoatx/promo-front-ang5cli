# PromoObrasAngularCli

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.7.

## Important Notes
Take into account that this application has been developed ONLY for my own personal training purposes so it is NOT fit for use in a production environment.

This Angular5 app was created to consume resources from a Node RESTful API application running on a different server. Go to my [`promo-back`](https://github.com/Albertoatx/promo-back) repo and follow the instructions to install it BEFORE running this front-end Angular5 app.


## Development server (Running of this Angular5 App)
Download or clone this repo.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. 

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## About the app
After starting the app you will be sent to the 'home' page. 

In that 'home' page you must create an user account if you still don't have one. 

With that user account you will be able to 'login' in the app (that creates a session in the back-end) and make use of most of the functionalities provided by the back-end app.

The list of users in the app, their deletion or edition can only be done using an 'admin' account.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
